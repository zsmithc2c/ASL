Participation in classroom discussions, timely submission of assignments, and engagement in hands-on activities are crucial for a thorough understanding of the course content.
Office Hours and Support
To support your learning and project progress, office hours are available every Friday from 5-6 PM and Saturday from 9-10 AM. Attendance at one office hour session by July 12 is mandatory for students enrolled in the June 11 - July 26 session, and by July 19 for the July 8 - 26 session. These office hours are an excellent opportunity to seek additional help, clarify doubts, and discuss project progress with instructors.
Individual and Group Work Expectations
Group Meetings: Starting from Week 4 (after Lesson 6), each group must schedule at least one meeting per week that lasts approximately one hour. These meetings are essential for coordinating project efforts, discussing progress, and planning next steps.
Independent Work: In addition to group meetings, each student is expected to dedicate 2-3 hours per week to independently work on their designated parts of the project. This work includes coding, research, and preparation of materials necessary for the ongoing development of the project. It is vital that the work done independently is directly aligned with the team's objectives and is prepared for integration into the main project repository.
Milestone Management: We will conduct milestone reviews during class to assess progress on your projects. It is important to come prepared to these sessions to discuss what you have accomplished, any challenges you've encountered, and your plans for moving forward. If you face any difficulties, do not hesitate to reach out for support immediately—proactive communication can prevent small issues from becoming significant obstacles.
